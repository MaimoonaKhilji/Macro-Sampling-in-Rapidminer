# Macro-Sampling-in-Rapidminer

* Try to build samples of 30% and 80% of the original size. What do you need to change? What are the resulting example set sizes?

* Replace the input example set ( Titanic ) with Iris from the Samples repository. Do you need to change anything else or will the process just execute fine? Try it!

* Have a look into the Parameters of Sample. Do you find a setting which would allow you to create a 50% sample of the data without calculating the size macro? Try to change the process but keep the fraction macro and use it directly for setting the fraction in the Sample operator
